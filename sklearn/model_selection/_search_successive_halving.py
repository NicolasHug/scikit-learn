    """Search over specified parameter values with successive halving.

    The search strategy starts evaluating all the candidates with a small
    amount of resources and iteratively selects the best candidates, using
    more and more resources.

    Read more in the :ref:`User guide <successive_halving_user_guide>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
        parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
        dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
        in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
        of parameter settings.

    scoring : string, callable, or None, default=None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.
        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs' (default)

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or iterable, default=5
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, default=True
        If True, refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the
        whole dataset.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``GridSearchCV`` instance.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error. Default is ``np.nan``

    return_train_score : boolean, default=False
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

    max_resources : int, default='auto'
        The maximum amount of resource that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. By default, this is set to ``n_samples`` when
        ``resource='n_samples'`` (default), else an error is raised.

    min_resources : {'exhaust', 'smallest'} or int, default='exhaust'
        The minimum amount of resource that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. Equivalently, this defines the amount of
        resources `r0` that are allocated for each candidate at the first
        iteration.

        - 'smallest' is a heuristic that sets `r0` to a small value:
            - ``n_splits * 2`` when ``resource='n_samples'`` for a regression
               problem
            - ``n_classes * n_splits * 2`` when ``resource='n_samples'`` for a
               regression problem
            - ``1`` when ``resource != 'n_samples'``
        - 'exhaust' will set `r0` such that the **last** iteration uses as
          much resources as possible. Namely, the last iteration will use the
          highest value smaller than ``max_resources`` that is a multiple of
          both ``min_resources`` and ``ratio``. In general, using 'exhaust'
          leads to a more accurate estimator, but is slightly more time
          consuming.

        Note that the amount of resources used at each iteration is always a
        multiple of ``min_resources``.

    resource : ``'n_samples'`` or str, default='n_samples'
        Defines the resource that increases with each iteration. By default,
        the resource is the number of samples. It can also be set to any
        parameter of the base estimator that accepts positive integer
        values, e.g. 'n_iterations' or 'n_estimators' for a gradient
        boosting estimator. In this case ``max_resources`` cannot be 'auto'
        and must be set explicitly.

    ratio : int or float, default=3
        The 'halving' parameter, which determines the proportion of candidates
        that are selected for each subsequent iteration. For example,
        ``ratio=3`` means that only one third of the candidates are selected.

    aggressive_elimination : bool, default=False
        This is only relevant in cases where there isn't enough resources to
        reduce the candidates to at most `ratio` in the last iteration. If
        ``True``, then the search process will 'replay' the first iteration
        for as long as needed until the number of candidates is small enough.
        This is ``False`` by default, which means that the last iteration may
        evaluate more than ``ratio`` candidates. See
        :ref:`aggressive_elimination` for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_candidates_ : list of int
        The number of candidate parameters that were evaluated at each
        iteration.

    n_remaining_candidates_ : int
        The number of candidate parameters that are left after the last
        iteration.

    max_resources_ : int
        The maximum number of resources that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. Note that since the number of resources used
        at each iteration must be a multiple of ``min_resources_``, the
        actual number of resources used at the last iteration may be smaller
        than ``max_resources_``.

    min_resources_ : int
        The amount of resources that are allocated for each candidate at the
        first iteration.

    n_iterations_ : int
        The actual number of iterations that were run. This is equal to
        ``n_required_iterations_`` if ``aggressive_elimination`` is ``True``.
        Else, this is equal to ``min(n_possible_iterations_,
        n_required_iterations_)``.

    n_possible_iterations_ : int
        The number of iterations that are possible starting with
        ``min_resources_`` resources and without exceeding
        ``max_resources_``.

    n_required_iterations_ : int
        The number of iterations that are required to end up with less than
        ``ratio`` candidates at the last iteration, starting with
        ``min_resources_`` resources. This will be smaller than
        ``n_possible_iterations_`` when there isn't enough resources.

    cv_results_ : dict of numpy (masked) ndarrays
        A dict with keys as column headers and values as columns, that can be
        imported into a pandas ``DataFrame``. It contains many informations for
        analysing the results of a search.
        Please refer to the :ref:`User guide<successive_halving_cv_results>`
        for details.

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    refit_time_ : float
        Seconds used for refitting the best model on the whole dataset.

        This is present only if ``refit`` is not False.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import HalvingGridSearchCV
    ...
    >>> X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
    ...
    >>> param_grid = {"max_depth": [3, None],
    ...               "min_samples_split": [5, 10]}
    >>> search = HalvingGridSearchCV(clf, param_grid, resource='n_estimators',
    ...                              max_resources=10,
    ...                              random_state=0).fit(X, y)
    >>> search.best_params_  # doctest: +SKIP
    {'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'n_estimators': 9}

    Notes
    -----
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the held-out
    data, according to the scoring parameter.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    parameter setting(and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.

class HalvingRandomSearchCV(BaseSuccessiveHalving):
    """Randomized search on hyper parameters.

    The search strategy starts evaluating all the candidates with a small
    amount of resources and iteratively selects the best candidates, using more
    and more resources.

    The candidates are sampled at random from the parameter space and the
    number of sampled candidates is determined by ``n_candidates``.

    Read more in the :ref:`User guide<successive_halving_user_guide>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_distributions : dict
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and distributions
        or lists of parameters to try. Distributions must provide a ``rvs``
        method for sampling (such as those from scipy.stats.distributions).
        If a list is given, it is sampled uniformly.

    n_candidates : int, default='exhaust'
        The number of candidate parameters to sample, at the first
        iteration. Using 'exhaust' will sample enough candidates so that the
        last iteration uses as many resources as possible, based on
        `min_resources`, `max_resources` and `ratio`. In this case,
        `min_resources` cannot be 'exhaust'.

    scoring : string, callable, or None, default=None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.
        If None, the estimator's score method is used.

    n_jobs : int or None, default=None
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.
        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs' (default)

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=5
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:

        - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
        - :term:`CV splitter`,
        - An iterable yielding (train, test) splits as arrays of indices.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, default=True
        If True, refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the
        whole dataset.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``GridSearchCV`` instance.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error. Default is ``np.nan``

    return_train_score : boolean, default=False
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

    max_resources : int, default='auto'
        The maximum number of resources that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. By default, this is set ``n_samples`` when
        ``resource='n_samples'`` (default), else an error is raised.

    min_resources : {'exhaust', 'smallest'} or int, default='smallest'
        The minimum amount of resource that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. Equivalently, this defines the amount of
        resources `r0` that are allocated for each candidate at the first
        iteration.

        - 'smallest' is a heuristic that sets `r0` to a small value:
            - ``n_splits * 2`` when ``resource='n_samples'`` for a regression
               problem
            - ``n_classes * n_splits * 2`` when ``resource='n_samples'`` for a
               regression problem
            - ``1`` when ``resource != 'n_samples'``
        - 'exhaust' will set `r0` such that the **last** iteration uses as
          much resources as possible. Namely, the last iteration will use the
          highest value smaller than ``max_resources`` that is a multiple of
          both ``min_resources`` and ``ratio``. In general, using 'exhaust'
          leads to a more accurate estimator, but is slightly more time
          consuming. 'exhaust' isn't available when `n_candidates='exhaust'`.

        Note that the amount of resources used at each iteration is always a
        multiple of ``min_resources``.

    resource : ``'n_samples'`` or str, default='n_samples'
        Defines the resource that increases with each iteration. By default,
        the resource is the number of samples. It can also be set to any
        parameter of the base estimator that accepts positive integer
        values, e.g. 'n_iterations' or 'n_estimators' for a gradient
        boosting estimator. In this case ``max_resources`` cannot be 'auto'
        and must be set explicitly.

    ratio : int or float, default=3
        The 'halving' parameter, which determines the proportion of candidates
        that are selected for each subsequent iteration. For example,
        ``ratio=3`` means that only one third of the candidates are selected.

    aggressive_elimination : bool, default=False
        This is only relevant in cases where there isn't enough resources to
        reduce the candidates to at most `ratio` in the last iteration. If
        ``True``, then the search process will 'replay' the first iteration
        for as long as needed until the number of candidates is small enough.
        This is ``False`` by default, which means that the last iteration may
        evaluate more than ``ratio`` candidates. See
        :ref:`aggressive_elimination` for more details.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_candidates_ : list of int
        The number of candidate parameters that were evaluated at each
        iteration.

    n_remaining_candidates_ : int
        The number of candidate parameters that are left after the last
        iteration.

    max_resources_ : int
        The maximum number of resources that any candidate is allowed to use
        for a given iteration. Note that since the number of resources used at
        each iteration must be a multiple of ``min_resources_``, the actual
        number of resources used at the last iteration may be smaller than
        ``max_resources_``.

    min_resources_ : int
        The amount of resources that are allocated for each candidate at the
        first iteration.

    n_iterations_ : int
        The actual number of iterations that were run. This is equal to
        ``n_required_iterations_`` if ``aggressive_elimination`` is ``True``.
        Else, this is equal to ``min(n_possible_iterations_,
        n_required_iterations_)``.

    n_possible_iterations_ : int
        The number of iterations that are possible starting with
        ``min_resources_`` resources and without exceeding
        ``max_resources_``.

    n_required_iterations_ : int
        The number of iterations that are required to end up with less than
        ``ratio`` candidates at the last iteration, starting with
        ``min_resources_`` resources. This will be smaller than
        ``n_possible_iterations_`` when there isn't enough resources.

    cv_results_ : dict of numpy (masked) ndarrays
        A dict with keys as column headers and values as columns, that can be
        imported into a pandas ``DataFrame``. It contains many informations for
        analysing the results of a search.
        Please refer to the :ref:`User guide<successive_halving_cv_results>`
        for details.

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    refit_time_ : float
        Seconds used for refitting the best model on the whole dataset.

        This is present only if ``refit`` is not False.
